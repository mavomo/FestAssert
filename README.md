FestAssert
==========

Lab : Using Fest-Assert for unit test 
source : http://blog.xebia.fr/2013/02/04/craftsman-recipes-refactorez-vos-tests-avec-genericassert-de-fest-assert/

Changes : 
 * I updated the code to comply to the version FEST-Assert 2.0 as proposed in the source comments.
 * I removed the assertj-assertions-generator-maven-plugin that is supposed to generate AssertJ assertion since I created my own custom assertion.
